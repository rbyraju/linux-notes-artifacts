I just had this problem with mine. As I was scrolling through replies, I decided to try a home fix. All I did was pull the dispenser out and remove the "caps" (the max fill line tabs...pull those off), and soaked all parts separately in vinegar for about 20 minutes. I didn't time it. I just soaked them until I remembered they were soaking hahaha!! I then scrubbed them with bottle brushes. All parts. I put it all back together and ran a load of wash hoping it fixed it. IT WORKED!!! It was just hard water deposits clogging the syphoning I assume. Give this a shot. Hope it helps others!

Below are cleanup system tools

BleachBit
Ubuntu Tweak
GCleaner
Sweeper

To remove any packages that aren't needed by the system:

sudo apt-get autoremove
The other answer for this question:

sudo apt-get clean
This just clears the package cache for downloading new packages, it will not uninstall any packages.

Running dex as a separate process.

To run dex in process, the Gradle daemon needs a larger heap.
It currently has 1024 MB.
For faster builds, increase the maximum heap size for the Gradle daemon to at least 1536 MB.
To do this set org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M in the project gradle.properties.
For more information see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html

I am not much into Linux. I am trying to setup a server through ssh. I installed apache php and mysql through this command.

sudo aptitude install apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server
but I think php is not enabled on the server.

When I run command I receive response as below

$ which apache2ctl
/usr/sbin/apache2ctl
But when I check $ which php I receive no response.

$ locate php5
/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/php5
/usr/share/ubuntu-serverguide/html/C/php5.html
